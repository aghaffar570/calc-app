A calculator app that logs the calculation as its happens and shares those calculations in a list with everyone connected on the site.

## local setup
Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory            
Type `npm install` followed by `npm run start` to begin the app

Any connections made to localhost:3000 from your IP will enter a new session              
and the calculations made will be broadcasted to every client on that IP
